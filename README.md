# Hello! My name is...

Github username: sahsan0

Samir Ahsan. I am a biochemistry undergraduate student at Purdue University interesting in building my technical skills in computer science. I pride myself in my physical coordination, my far-reaching curiosity, and desire for complimentary universal change. I enjoy playing instruments, reading, and exerting biomechanical force in the face of obstacles designed for human enjoyment (sports). I pride myself in observing the world in an obscure lense,  beyond what it may seem; endlessly reaching to define what I believe. I wish to master my physical and spiritual self through knowledge and reason. I hope to learn from which I know and that which I don't. Let the everpresent forces of chaos align for good fortune those I love and myself.
